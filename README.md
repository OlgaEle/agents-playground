# ðŸ¤– Agents Playground

Welcome to my little Agents Playground â€” a space where I experiment, learn, and have fun with different kinds of agents!

Each project lives in its own folder and includes its own code, `README.md`, and `requirements.txt` files (if needed) â€” making it easy to explore or run independently.

So, here, you'll find a mix of mini and more complex projects. Some use **manual, rule-based agents** (no AI), while others involve **AI-powered logic** to explore decision-making, movement, and interaction.

The goal? To understand how agents behave, test out different ideas, and get hands-on with both simple and smarter systems â€” all in Python.

Youâ€™ll find explanations inside the individual `README.md` files of each project folder to help make things easier to follow (or to remind myself later!ðŸ¤“).

This is an ongoing project â€” feel free to explore, learn, or even build on top of it. ðŸš€
