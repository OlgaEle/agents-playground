# ðŸ¤– Agents Playground

Welcome to my little **Agents Playground** â€” a space where I experiment, learn, and have fun with different kinds of agents!

Inside the `playground/` folder, you'll find a mix of mini and more complex projects. Some use **manual, rule-based agents** (no AI), while others involve **AI-powered logic** to explore decision-making, movement, and interaction.

The goal? To **understand how agents behave**, test out different ideas, and get hands-on with both simple and smarter systems â€” all in Python.

In the `docs/` folder, Iâ€™ve added explanations for some of the projects to make things easier to follow (or to remind myself later!ðŸ¤“).

This is an ongoing project â€” feel free to explore, learn, or even build on top of it. ðŸš€
